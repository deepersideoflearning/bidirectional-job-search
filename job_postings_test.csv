internal audit - forensic data scientist,"Internal Audit Forensic Data Scientist

You are a data scientist who wants to grow your career with a truly great company. You have excellent judgement and knowledge of business processes and can effectively apply a risk-based approach to pulling the right data and analyzing the high-risk areas to inform internal audits and business leaders. You work well with others but are independently motivated to make a difference, drive value, provide meaningful recommendations, and get the work done. You’re a curious, determined, action-oriented person, who is motivated to achieve excellence. Are you ready to join us?

In this role, you will have a unique opportunity to see first-hand the financial and operational activities performed in our different business segments. With visibility of the entire company, you can make an immediate impact by delivering data analysis that provides value to management and the board of directors through actionable insight to drive efficiencies and help correct suboptimal behavior. This goes beyond traditional “rules-based” queries and includes anomaly detection, clustering, risk ranking, data visualization, and text mining to assess risks and compliance, detect issues, and identify and predict anomalies.

Internal Audit at Weyerhaeuser is a dynamic, well-respected team that has a strong reputation maintained by knowledgeable team members who deliver timely assurance, identify process improvement opportunities in support of stakeholders, and have great relationships with company leaders and teams built by taking the time to understand their businesses and systems and clearly communicate with candor to provide meaningful feedback and recommendations. You will be a valuable member of this team, and you will work closely with the auditors; however, you will be driving the data analytics to support the audits and risk assessments (as opposed to performing the audit work and testing procedures).


Primary Responsibilities
You will be responsible for working with our IT and business intelligence teams to pull data from different key applications across the company, validate completeness and accuracy of the data, and then use the data to inform our internal audits, investigations, and management insight. This may include mathematical regression and regression analysis, coding and/or advanced queries, statistical-based analysis, anomaly/trend/pattern detection, clustering, risk-ranking, data visualization, and/or text mining.
Essential to this role is the ability to translate the data into easy to understand views for communication and reporting.
This is a new role on our team, so you will be paving the way in terms of setting and driving the approach for collecting the right data based on risk, building a data analytics roadmap, and then creating the reports and dashboards with the appropriate views. This will include analysis of different business and functional areas across the company.
You will be responsible for continuously monitoring the data to regularly inform our audit team or management of high-risk areas or anomalies requiring follow-up.
This role will also be looked to as a potential resource for management/leaders outside of audit, so you may also be asked to help with ad-hoc management requests related to data, analytics, or investigations (as they come up).
Qualifications
Bachelor’s degree required in related field (e.g., financial mathematics, actuarial science, management information systems, computer science, accounting, finance, economics, applied statistics)
6 or more years of focused experience in data analytics, forensic data collection, risk/compliance assessments or investigations, advisory, data science, and/or mathematical regression. Since this is a new role, we are open to candidates with more (or slightly less) experience, as long as the technical data expertise and ability to perform the work is apparent. Comp and level will depend on relevant experience.
Public accounting or advisory experience strongly preferred
Familiarity and/or experience working with/in a forensic team using fraud detection technologies and data analysis tools strongly preferred
Proficiency with large data sets and coding tools (.net, Power BI, Python, R, Access, SQL, SharePoint) required
Proficiency in Microsoft Office Suite (Excel, Word, PowerPoint) required
Working knowledge, understanding, and skills using key applications like SAP and PeopleSoft strongly preferred
Practical working experience with financial or business processes (or evaluation of these processes from an audit perspective) and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) strongly preferred
Relevant certifications provide a competitive advantage (e.g., Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE))
Strong verbal and written communication skills required
Can communicate the “so what” message to all levels of an organization
Takes ownerships of projects; results and recommendations are delivered with confidence
Supports others; solid team player; knows how to win together
Ability to identify potential issues and develop recommendations based on analysis and critical thinking/reasoning skills; adept at using sound reasoning to reach conclusions
Attention to detail and an ability to focus on the big picture
Demonstrated ability to solve complex problems in the absence of technical guidelines or precedents
Helps offer meaningful recommendations that address the root cause rather than symptoms
Demonstrates professional judgement to operate in gray areas
Demonstrates integrity and strong ethical behavior
Builds trust with others through personal authenticity and follow-through on commitments
Actively listens and builds rapport with others
Open and collegial work style with ability to listen and integrate ideas from diverse views and collaborate with others
Process-oriented, highly organized, and effective with time management
Ability to prioritize multiple tasks while maintaining critical attention to detail
Customer-service oriented and track record of positive feedback and demonstrated ability to provide excellent service to stakeholders
Some opportunity to travel to business/site locations to learn the operations (or possibly help with investigations), but regularly occurring travel is not a general expectation or requirement for this role.

internal audit - forensic data scientist,"Internal Audit Forensic Data Scientist

You are a data scientist who wants to grow your career with a truly great company. You have excellent judgement and knowledge of business processes and can effectively apply a risk-based approach to pulling the right data and analyzing the high-risk areas to inform internal audits and business leaders. You work well with others but are independently motivated to make a difference, drive value, provide meaningful recommendations, and get the work done. You’re a curious, determined, action-oriented person, who is motivated to achieve excellence. Are you ready to join us?

In this role, you will have a unique opportunity to see first-hand the financial and operational activities performed in our different business segments. With visibility of the entire company, you can make an immediate impact by delivering data analysis that provides value to management and the board of directors through actionable insight to drive efficiencies and help correct suboptimal behavior. This goes beyond traditional “rules-based” queries and includes anomaly detection, clustering, risk ranking, data visualization, and text mining to assess risks and compliance, detect issues, and identify and predict anomalies.

Internal Audit at Weyerhaeuser is a dynamic, well-respected team that has a strong reputation maintained by knowledgeable team members who deliver timely assurance, identify process improvement opportunities in support of stakeholders, and have great relationships with company leaders and teams built by taking the time to understand their businesses and systems and clearly communicate with candor to provide meaningful feedback and recommendations. You will be a valuable member of this team, and you will work closely with the auditors; however, you will be driving the data analytics to support the audits and risk assessments (as opposed to performing the audit work and testing procedures).


Primary Responsibilities
You will be responsible for working with our IT and business intelligence teams to pull data from different key applications across the company, validate completeness and accuracy of the data, and then use the data to inform our internal audits, investigations, and management insight. This may include mathematical regression and regression analysis, coding and/or advanced queries, statistical-based analysis, anomaly/trend/pattern detection, clustering, risk-ranking, data visualization, and/or text mining.
Essential to this role is the ability to translate the data into easy to understand views for communication and reporting.
This is a new role on our team, so you will be paving the way in terms of setting and driving the approach for collecting the right data based on risk, building a data analytics roadmap, and then creating the reports and dashboards with the appropriate views. This will include analysis of different business and functional areas across the company.
You will be responsible for continuously monitoring the data to regularly inform our audit team or management of high-risk areas or anomalies requiring follow-up.
This role will also be looked to as a potential resource for management/leaders outside of audit, so you may also be asked to help with ad-hoc management requests related to data, analytics, or investigations (as they come up).
Qualifications
Bachelor’s degree required in related field (e.g., financial mathematics, actuarial science, management information systems, computer science, accounting, finance, economics, applied statistics)
6 or more years of focused experience in data analytics, forensic data collection, risk/compliance assessments or investigations, advisory, data science, and/or mathematical regression. Since this is a new role, we are open to candidates with more (or slightly less) experience, as long as the technical data expertise and ability to perform the work is apparent. Comp and level will depend on relevant experience.
Public accounting or advisory experience strongly preferred
Familiarity and/or experience working with/in a forensic team using fraud detection technologies and data analysis tools strongly preferred
Proficiency with large data sets and coding tools (.net, Power BI, Python, R, Access, SQL, SharePoint) required
Proficiency in Microsoft Office Suite (Excel, Word, PowerPoint) required
Working knowledge, understanding, and skills using key applications like SAP and PeopleSoft strongly preferred
Practical working experience with financial or business processes (or evaluation of these processes from an audit perspective) and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) strongly preferred
Relevant certifications provide a competitive advantage (e.g., Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE))
Strong verbal and written communication skills required
Can communicate the “so what” message to all levels of an organization
Takes ownerships of projects; results and recommendations are delivered with confidence
Supports others; solid team player; knows how to win together
Ability to identify potential issues and develop recommendations based on analysis and critical thinking/reasoning skills; adept at using sound reasoning to reach conclusions
Attention to detail and an ability to focus on the big picture
Demonstrated ability to solve complex problems in the absence of technical guidelines or precedents
Helps offer meaningful recommendations that address the root cause rather than symptoms
Demonstrates professional judgement to operate in gray areas
Demonstrates integrity and strong ethical behavior
Builds trust with others through personal authenticity and follow-through on commitments
Actively listens and builds rapport with others
Open and collegial work style with ability to listen and integrate ideas from diverse views and collaborate with others
Process-oriented, highly organized, and effective with time management
Ability to prioritize multiple tasks while maintaining critical attention to detail
Customer-service oriented and track record of positive feedback and demonstrated ability to provide excellent service to stakeholders
Some opportunity to travel to business/site locations to learn the operations (or possibly help with investigations), but regularly occurring travel is not a general expectation or requirement for this role.

internal audit - forensic data scientist,"Internal Audit Forensic Data Scientist

You are a data scientist who wants to grow your career with a truly great company. You have excellent judgement and knowledge of business processes and can effectively apply a risk-based approach to pulling the right data and analyzing the high-risk areas to inform internal audits and business leaders. You work well with others but are independently motivated to make a difference, drive value, provide meaningful recommendations, and get the work done. You’re a curious, determined, action-oriented person, who is motivated to achieve excellence. Are you ready to join us?

In this role, you will have a unique opportunity to see first-hand the financial and operational activities performed in our different business segments. With visibility of the entire company, you can make an immediate impact by delivering data analysis that provides value to management and the board of directors through actionable insight to drive efficiencies and help correct suboptimal behavior. This goes beyond traditional “rules-based” queries and includes anomaly detection, clustering, risk ranking, data visualization, and text mining to assess risks and compliance, detect issues, and identify and predict anomalies.

Internal Audit at Weyerhaeuser is a dynamic, well-respected team that has a strong reputation maintained by knowledgeable team members who deliver timely assurance, identify process improvement opportunities in support of stakeholders, and have great relationships with company leaders and teams built by taking the time to understand their businesses and systems and clearly communicate with candor to provide meaningful feedback and recommendations. You will be a valuable member of this team, and you will work closely with the auditors; however, you will be driving the data analytics to support the audits and risk assessments (as opposed to performing the audit work and testing procedures).


Primary Responsibilities
You will be responsible for working with our IT and business intelligence teams to pull data from different key applications across the company, validate completeness and accuracy of the data, and then use the data to inform our internal audits, investigations, and management insight. This may include mathematical regression and regression analysis, coding and/or advanced queries, statistical-based analysis, anomaly/trend/pattern detection, clustering, risk-ranking, data visualization, and/or text mining.
Essential to this role is the ability to translate the data into easy to understand views for communication and reporting.
This is a new role on our team, so you will be paving the way in terms of setting and driving the approach for collecting the right data based on risk, building a data analytics roadmap, and then creating the reports and dashboards with the appropriate views. This will include analysis of different business and functional areas across the company.
You will be responsible for continuously monitoring the data to regularly inform our audit team or management of high-risk areas or anomalies requiring follow-up.
This role will also be looked to as a potential resource for management/leaders outside of audit, so you may also be asked to help with ad-hoc management requests related to data, analytics, or investigations (as they come up).
Qualifications
Bachelor’s degree required in related field (e.g., financial mathematics, actuarial science, management information systems, computer science, accounting, finance, economics, applied statistics)
6 or more years of focused experience in data analytics, forensic data collection, risk/compliance assessments or investigations, advisory, data science, and/or mathematical regression. Since this is a new role, we are open to candidates with more (or slightly less) experience, as long as the technical data expertise and ability to perform the work is apparent. Comp and level will depend on relevant experience.
Public accounting or advisory experience strongly preferred
Familiarity and/or experience working with/in a forensic team using fraud detection technologies and data analysis tools strongly preferred
Proficiency with large data sets and coding tools (.net, Power BI, Python, R, Access, SQL, SharePoint) required
Proficiency in Microsoft Office Suite (Excel, Word, PowerPoint) required
Working knowledge, understanding, and skills using key applications like SAP and PeopleSoft strongly preferred
Practical working experience with financial or business processes (or evaluation of these processes from an audit perspective) and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) strongly preferred
Relevant certifications provide a competitive advantage (e.g., Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE))
Strong verbal and written communication skills required
Can communicate the “so what” message to all levels of an organization
Takes ownerships of projects; results and recommendations are delivered with confidence
Supports others; solid team player; knows how to win together
Ability to identify potential issues and develop recommendations based on analysis and critical thinking/reasoning skills; adept at using sound reasoning to reach conclusions
Attention to detail and an ability to focus on the big picture
Demonstrated ability to solve complex problems in the absence of technical guidelines or precedents
Helps offer meaningful recommendations that address the root cause rather than symptoms
Demonstrates professional judgement to operate in gray areas
Demonstrates integrity and strong ethical behavior
Builds trust with others through personal authenticity and follow-through on commitments
Actively listens and builds rapport with others
Open and collegial work style with ability to listen and integrate ideas from diverse views and collaborate with others
Process-oriented, highly organized, and effective with time management
Ability to prioritize multiple tasks while maintaining critical attention to detail
Customer-service oriented and track record of positive feedback and demonstrated ability to provide excellent service to stakeholders
Some opportunity to travel to business/site locations to learn the operations (or possibly help with investigations), but regularly occurring travel is not a general expectation or requirement for this role.

internal audit - forensic data scientist,"Internal Audit Forensic Data Scientist

You are a data scientist who wants to grow your career with a truly great company. You have excellent judgement and knowledge of business processes and can effectively apply a risk-based approach to pulling the right data and analyzing the high-risk areas to inform internal audits and business leaders. You work well with others but are independently motivated to make a difference, drive value, provide meaningful recommendations, and get the work done. You’re a curious, determined, action-oriented person, who is motivated to achieve excellence. Are you ready to join us?

In this role, you will have a unique opportunity to see first-hand the financial and operational activities performed in our different business segments. With visibility of the entire company, you can make an immediate impact by delivering data analysis that provides value to management and the board of directors through actionable insight to drive efficiencies and help correct suboptimal behavior. This goes beyond traditional “rules-based” queries and includes anomaly detection, clustering, risk ranking, data visualization, and text mining to assess risks and compliance, detect issues, and identify and predict anomalies.

Internal Audit at Weyerhaeuser is a dynamic, well-respected team that has a strong reputation maintained by knowledgeable team members who deliver timely assurance, identify process improvement opportunities in support of stakeholders, and have great relationships with company leaders and teams built by taking the time to understand their businesses and systems and clearly communicate with candor to provide meaningful feedback and recommendations. You will be a valuable member of this team, and you will work closely with the auditors; however, you will be driving the data analytics to support the audits and risk assessments (as opposed to performing the audit work and testing procedures).


Primary Responsibilities
You will be responsible for working with our IT and business intelligence teams to pull data from different key applications across the company, validate completeness and accuracy of the data, and then use the data to inform our internal audits, investigations, and management insight. This may include mathematical regression and regression analysis, coding and/or advanced queries, statistical-based analysis, anomaly/trend/pattern detection, clustering, risk-ranking, data visualization, and/or text mining.
Essential to this role is the ability to translate the data into easy to understand views for communication and reporting.
This is a new role on our team, so you will be paving the way in terms of setting and driving the approach for collecting the right data based on risk, building a data analytics roadmap, and then creating the reports and dashboards with the appropriate views. This will include analysis of different business and functional areas across the company.
You will be responsible for continuously monitoring the data to regularly inform our audit team or management of high-risk areas or anomalies requiring follow-up.
This role will also be looked to as a potential resource for management/leaders outside of audit, so you may also be asked to help with ad-hoc management requests related to data, analytics, or investigations (as they come up).
Qualifications
Bachelor’s degree required in related field (e.g., financial mathematics, actuarial science, management information systems, computer science, accounting, finance, economics, applied statistics)
6 or more years of focused experience in data analytics, forensic data collection, risk/compliance assessments or investigations, advisory, data science, and/or mathematical regression. Since this is a new role, we are open to candidates with more (or slightly less) experience, as long as the technical data expertise and ability to perform the work is apparent. Comp and level will depend on relevant experience.
Public accounting or advisory experience strongly preferred
Familiarity and/or experience working with/in a forensic team using fraud detection technologies and data analysis tools strongly preferred
Proficiency with large data sets and coding tools (.net, Power BI, Python, R, Access, SQL, SharePoint) required
Proficiency in Microsoft Office Suite (Excel, Word, PowerPoint) required
Working knowledge, understanding, and skills using key applications like SAP and PeopleSoft strongly preferred
Practical working experience with financial or business processes (or evaluation of these processes from an audit perspective) and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) strongly preferred
Relevant certifications provide a competitive advantage (e.g., Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE))
Strong verbal and written communication skills required
Can communicate the “so what” message to all levels of an organization
Takes ownerships of projects; results and recommendations are delivered with confidence
Supports others; solid team player; knows how to win together
Ability to identify potential issues and develop recommendations based on analysis and critical thinking/reasoning skills; adept at using sound reasoning to reach conclusions
Attention to detail and an ability to focus on the big picture
Demonstrated ability to solve complex problems in the absence of technical guidelines or precedents
Helps offer meaningful recommendations that address the root cause rather than symptoms
Demonstrates professional judgement to operate in gray areas
Demonstrates integrity and strong ethical behavior
Builds trust with others through personal authenticity and follow-through on commitments
Actively listens and builds rapport with others
Open and collegial work style with ability to listen and integrate ideas from diverse views and collaborate with others
Process-oriented, highly organized, and effective with time management
Ability to prioritize multiple tasks while maintaining critical attention to detail
Customer-service oriented and track record of positive feedback and demonstrated ability to provide excellent service to stakeholders
Some opportunity to travel to business/site locations to learn the operations (or possibly help with investigations), but regularly occurring travel is not a general expectation or requirement for this role.

Nehemiah Security is in search of Mid to Senior level Data Scientist. The data scientist will be responsible for creating models that pertain to our customers’ vulnerability to cyber attack given technical details of how the customer’s technology infrastructure is set up; and models that pertain to how a customer’s business is financially exposed to an attacker exploiting those vulnerabilities. The Data Scientist will report to the Global Chief Technology Officer.
In order to make the models relevant to a specific customer, the successful candidate will have to work with data that considers the current cyber threat environment globally, the customer’s exposure to those threats (in terms of their technology infrastructure’s configuration) and the financial losses that those threats could cause. Since the models are of a range of possible attacks, considering the personality and motivation of the attacker, as well as the possible responses from the company, the models must produce a range of outputs at different probabilities.

The Buzz on Nehemiah Security

Nehemiah Security is a fast-growing cybersecurity software company with a passion for building great software. We are leading the way in transforming how companies manage their cyber risk. Here’s what’s important to us: our people, adding value to our customers, innovation, creativity, hard work, persistence, fearlessness, speed, passion, faith, and teamwork. We're growing fast and we're looking for hard working people who are driven by professional and personal growth to help us disrupt the cyber analytics market. Rated as one of the top 25 best places to work in the Washington DC area, Nehemiah Security is an awesome company to join that can help launch and define your career.


What You’ll Do
Designing models that can produce both the magnitude and probability of a company losing money due to multiple cyber events
Designing models that can produce both the magnitude and probability of a company incurring indirect, longer term losses related to reputation damage
Designing sensitivity models that can capture the financial effect of the theft of an organization’s secrets
Working with the other members of the data science team to build a complete set of models that consider the types of attack, the personalities and motivations of the attacker, the customer infrastructure’s resilience to those attacks and the response of the defenders within the customer
Working with the developers and subject matter experts in cybersecurity, IT and business infrastructure in order to design and specify the required inputs to any models, and how to go about gathering them from the customer’s environment or the global threat landscape
Working with the development and architecture teams to take proof of concept models and productise them
Working with the QA team to ensure that the outputs of models can be tested and validated when in production

internal audit - forensic data scientist,"Internal Audit Forensic Data Scientist

You are a data scientist who wants to grow your career with a truly great company. You have excellent judgement and knowledge of business processes and can effectively apply a risk-based approach to pulling the right data and analyzing the high-risk areas to inform internal audits and business leaders. You work well with others but are independently motivated to make a difference, drive value, provide meaningful recommendations, and get the work done. You’re a curious, determined, action-oriented person, who is motivated to achieve excellence. Are you ready to join us?

In this role, you will have a unique opportunity to see first-hand the financial and operational activities performed in our different business segments. With visibility of the entire company, you can make an immediate impact by delivering data analysis that provides value to management and the board of directors through actionable insight to drive efficiencies and help correct suboptimal behavior. This goes beyond traditional “rules-based” queries and includes anomaly detection, clustering, risk ranking, data visualization, and text mining to assess risks and compliance, detect issues, and identify and predict anomalies.

Internal Audit at Weyerhaeuser is a dynamic, well-respected team that has a strong reputation maintained by knowledgeable team members who deliver timely assurance, identify process improvement opportunities in support of stakeholders, and have great relationships with company leaders and teams built by taking the time to understand their businesses and systems and clearly communicate with candor to provide meaningful feedback and recommendations. You will be a valuable member of this team, and you will work closely with the auditors; however, you will be driving the data analytics to support the audits and risk assessments (as opposed to performing the audit work and testing procedures).


Primary Responsibilities
You will be responsible for working with our IT and business intelligence teams to pull data from different key applications across the company, validate completeness and accuracy of the data, and then use the data to inform our internal audits, investigations, and management insight. This may include mathematical regression and regression analysis, coding and/or advanced queries, statistical-based analysis, anomaly/trend/pattern detection, clustering, risk-ranking, data visualization, and/or text mining.
Essential to this role is the ability to translate the data into easy to understand views for communication and reporting.
This is a new role on our team, so you will be paving the way in terms of setting and driving the approach for collecting the right data based on risk, building a data analytics roadmap, and then creating the reports and dashboards with the appropriate views. This will include analysis of different business and functional areas across the company.
You will be responsible for continuously monitoring the data to regularly inform our audit team or management of high-risk areas or anomalies requiring follow-up.
This role will also be looked to as a potential resource for management/leaders outside of audit, so you may also be asked to help with ad-hoc management requests related to data, analytics, or investigations (as they come up).
Qualifications
Bachelor’s degree required in related field (e.g., financial mathematics, actuarial science, management information systems, computer science, accounting, finance, economics, applied statistics)
6 or more years of focused experience in data analytics, forensic data collection, risk/compliance assessments or investigations, advisory, data science, and/or mathematical regression. Since this is a new role, we are open to candidates with more (or slightly less) experience, as long as the technical data expertise and ability to perform the work is apparent. Comp and level will depend on relevant experience.
Public accounting or advisory experience strongly preferred
Familiarity and/or experience working with/in a forensic team using fraud detection technologies and data analysis tools strongly preferred
Proficiency with large data sets and coding tools (.net, Power BI, Python, R, Access, SQL, SharePoint) required
Proficiency in Microsoft Office Suite (Excel, Word, PowerPoint) required
Working knowledge, understanding, and skills using key applications like SAP and PeopleSoft strongly preferred
Practical working experience with financial or business processes (or evaluation of these processes from an audit perspective) and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) strongly preferred
Relevant certifications provide a competitive advantage (e.g., Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE))
Strong verbal and written communication skills required
Can communicate the “so what” message to all levels of an organization
Takes ownerships of projects; results and recommendations are delivered with confidence
Supports others; solid team player; knows how to win together
Ability to identify potential issues and develop recommendations based on analysis and critical thinking/reasoning skills; adept at using sound reasoning to reach conclusions
Attention to detail and an ability to focus on the big picture
Demonstrated ability to solve complex problems in the absence of technical guidelines or precedents
Helps offer meaningful recommendations that address the root cause rather than symptoms
Demonstrates professional judgement to operate in gray areas
Demonstrates integrity and strong ethical behavior
Builds trust with others through personal authenticity and follow-through on commitments
Actively listens and builds rapport with others
Open and collegial work style with ability to listen and integrate ideas from diverse views and collaborate with others
Process-oriented, highly organized, and effective with time management
Ability to prioritize multiple tasks while maintaining critical attention to detail
Customer-service oriented and track record of positive feedback and demonstrated ability to provide excellent service to stakeholders
Some opportunity to travel to business/site locations to learn the operations (or possibly help with investigations), but regularly occurring travel is not a general expectation or requirement for this role.

Nehemiah Security is in search of Mid to Senior level Data Scientist. The data scientist will be responsible for creating models that pertain to our customers’ vulnerability to cyber attack given technical details of how the customer’s technology infrastructure is set up; and models that pertain to how a customer’s business is financially exposed to an attacker exploiting those vulnerabilities. The Data Scientist will report to the Global Chief Technology Officer.
In order to make the models relevant to a specific customer, the successful candidate will have to work with data that considers the current cyber threat environment globally, the customer’s exposure to those threats (in terms of their technology infrastructure’s configuration) and the financial losses that those threats could cause. Since the models are of a range of possible attacks, considering the personality and motivation of the attacker, as well as the possible responses from the company, the models must produce a range of outputs at different probabilities.

The Buzz on Nehemiah Security

Nehemiah Security is a fast-growing cybersecurity software company with a passion for building great software. We are leading the way in transforming how companies manage their cyber risk.

A fulfillment center can appear to be a chaotic place. With millions of items moving in and out of an area twice as large as your average theme park every day, a quick peek under the roof would reveal a manic scene. You would see associates, machinery, vehicles, robots, and packages flying about at break-neck speeds and accessing a breathtaking number of shelves and bins that store products. In reality, however, this activity is all highly organized and orchestrated by software, with each movement carefully planned and optimized. However, there are times when mistakes occur: products may disappear, reappear in strange places, become damaged, or worse. When that happens, how does a fulfillment center operating at that size, speed, and scale recover gracefully and with minimal cost? How do we ensure that we meet our commitments to our customers and merchants? How do we find a needle in a haystack when we’re constantly shuffling the haystack around? And how do we do it at extreme scale in an environment of constant growth?

That’s where we come in, the AFT Inventory Entropy Management team. Our goal is to prevent entropy in a system in which there are billions of transactions driven by human and robotic input across hundreds of millions of items every year. We must ensure that the virtual and physical state of the world is aligned inside hundreds of Amazon’s fulfillment centers globally. When our job is done well mistakes are corrected quickly, and products are always ready to sell and ship.

We operate at a nexus of machine learning, computer vision, robotics, and healthy measure of hard-earned expertise in operations to build automated, algorithmic approaches to solving these problems at minimal cost. We create cutting edge software, building automated processes and workflows in the most complex operational problem space in the business world. So what should you expect from this role?

Major responsibilities: As a Data Scientist you will be working in one of the world's largest and most complex data analytics environments. You should have deep expertise in analyzing huge data sets from multiple domains. You should be expert at designing and implementing solutions that use a range of data science methodologies to automate data analysis or to solve complex business problems. You will design metrics for complex systems. You will deep dive ML training data and feature sets to drive improvements. You will partner with Research and Applied Scientists, SDEs, Technical Program Managers, Product Managers, and business leaders to identify solutions to large problems in Amazon Operations.

Your analysis and solution recommendations will drive system optimizations with global impact. You will develop metrics to quantify the benefits of a solution and influence project resources. You will audit metric data and use it to measure system impact and performance.

You will harness massive and diverse data sets to mine actionable insights for senior leaders. You will automate data feeds, validate the data input and analyze trends that lead to cost saving initiatives. In this role, you will own solving problems through deep data review, statistical analyses, and creation of analytic tools usable by others on the team. Your work products will guide our reporting, benchmarking, program optimization, financial planning, and execution strategy.

The ideal candidate is a motivated self-starter who can thrive in a fast paced environment. They will enjoy working in a multidisciplinary team of engineers, scientists and business leaders. They will seek to understand processes behind data so their recommendations are grounded.

internal audit - forensic data scientist,"Internal Audit Forensic Data Scientist

You are a data scientist who wants to grow your career with a truly great company. You have excellent judgement and knowledge of business processes and can effectively apply a risk-based approach to pulling the right data and analyzing the high-risk areas to inform internal audits and business leaders. You work well with others but are independently motivated to make a difference, drive value, provide meaningful recommendations, and get the work done. You’re a curious, determined, action-oriented person, who is motivated to achieve excellence. Are you ready to join us?

In this role, you will have a unique opportunity to see first-hand the financial and operational activities performed in our different business segments. With visibility of the entire company, you can make an immediate impact by delivering data analysis that provides value to management and the board of directors through actionable insight to drive efficiencies and help correct suboptimal behavior. This goes beyond traditional “rules-based” queries and includes anomaly detection, clustering, risk ranking, data visualization, and text mining to assess risks and compliance, detect issues, and identify and predict anomalies.

Internal Audit at Weyerhaeuser is a dynamic, well-respected team that has a strong reputation maintained by knowledgeable team members who deliver timely assurance, identify process improvement opportunities in support of stakeholders, and have great relationships with company leaders and teams built by taking the time to understand their businesses and systems and clearly communicate with candor to provide meaningful feedback and recommendations. You will be a valuable member of this team, and you will work closely with the auditors; however, you will be driving the data analytics to support the audits and risk assessments (as opposed to performing the audit work and testing procedures).


Primary Responsibilities
You will be responsible for working with our IT and business intelligence teams to pull data from different key applications across the company, validate completeness and accuracy of the data, and then use the data to inform our internal audits, investigations, and management insight. This may include mathematical regression and regression analysis, coding and/or advanced queries, statistical-based analysis, anomaly/trend/pattern detection, clustering, risk-ranking, data visualization, and/or text mining.
Essential to this role is the ability to translate the data into easy to understand views for communication and reporting.
This is a new role on our team, so you will be paving the way in terms of setting and driving the approach for collecting the right data based on risk, building a data analytics roadmap, and then creating the reports and dashboards with the appropriate views. This will include analysis of different business and functional areas across the company.
You will be responsible for continuously monitoring the data to regularly inform our audit team or management of high-risk areas or anomalies requiring follow-up.
This role will also be looked to as a potential resource for management/leaders outside of audit, so you may also be asked to help with ad-hoc management requests related to data, analytics, or investigations (as they come up).
Qualifications
Bachelor’s degree required in related field (e.g., financial mathematics, actuarial science, management information systems, computer science, accounting, finance, economics, applied statistics)
6 or more years of focused experience in data analytics, forensic data collection, risk/compliance assessments or investigations, advisory, data science, and/or mathematical regression. Since this is a new role, we are open to candidates with more (or slightly less) experience, as long as the technical data expertise and ability to perform the work is apparent. Comp and level will depend on relevant experience.
Public accounting or advisory experience strongly preferred
Familiarity and/or experience working with/in a forensic team using fraud detection technologies and data analysis tools strongly preferred
Proficiency with large data sets and coding tools (.net, Power BI, Python, R, Access, SQL, SharePoint) required
Proficiency in Microsoft Office Suite (Excel, Word, PowerPoint) required
Working knowledge, understanding, and skills using key applications like SAP and PeopleSoft strongly preferred
Practical working experience with financial or business processes (or evaluation of these processes from an audit perspective) and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) strongly preferred
Relevant certifications provide a competitive advantage (e.g., Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE))
Strong verbal and written communication skills required
Can communicate the “so what” message to all levels of an organization
Takes ownerships of projects; results and recommendations are delivered with confidence
Supports others; solid team player; knows how to win together
Ability to identify potential issues and develop recommendations based on analysis and critical thinking/reasoning skills; adept at using sound reasoning to reach conclusions
Attention to detail and an ability to focus on the big picture
Demonstrated ability to solve complex problems in the absence of technical guidelines or precedents
Helps offer meaningful recommendations that address the root cause rather than symptoms
Demonstrates professional judgement to operate in gray areas
Demonstrates integrity and strong ethical behavior
Builds trust with others through personal authenticity and follow-through on commitments
Actively listens and builds rapport with others
Open and collegial work style with ability to listen and integrate ideas from diverse views and collaborate with others
Process-oriented, highly organized, and effective with time management
Ability to prioritize multiple tasks while maintaining critical attention to detail
Customer-service oriented and track record of positive feedback and demonstrated ability to provide excellent service to stakeholders
Some opportunity to travel to business/site locations to learn the operations (or possibly help with investigations), but regularly occurring travel is not a general expectation or requirement for this role.

internal audit - forensic data scientist,"Internal Audit Forensic Data Scientist

You are a data scientist who wants to grow your career with a truly great company. You have excellent judgement and knowledge of business processes and can effectively apply a risk-based approach to pulling the right data and analyzing the high-risk areas to inform internal audits and business leaders. You work well with others but are independently motivated to make a difference, drive value, provide meaningful recommendations, and get the work done. You’re a curious, determined, action-oriented person, who is motivated to achieve excellence. Are you ready to join us?

In this role, you will have a unique opportunity to see first-hand the financial and operational activities performed in our different business segments. With visibility of the entire company, you can make an immediate impact by delivering data analysis that provides value to management and the board of directors through actionable insight to drive efficiencies and help correct suboptimal behavior. This goes beyond traditional “rules-based” queries and includes anomaly detection, clustering, risk ranking, data visualization, and text mining to assess risks and compliance, detect issues, and identify and predict anomalies.

Internal Audit at Weyerhaeuser is a dynamic, well-respected team that has a strong reputation maintained by knowledgeable team members who deliver timely assurance, identify process improvement opportunities in support of stakeholders, and have great relationships with company leaders and teams built by taking the time to understand their businesses and systems and clearly communicate with candor to provide meaningful feedback and recommendations. You will be a valuable member of this team, and you will work closely with the auditors; however, you will be driving the data analytics to support the audits and risk assessments (as opposed to performing the audit work and testing procedures).


Primary Responsibilities
You will be responsible for working with our IT and business intelligence teams to pull data from different key applications across the company, validate completeness and accuracy of the data, and then use the data to inform our internal audits, investigations, and management insight. This may include mathematical regression and regression analysis, coding and/or advanced queries, statistical-based analysis, anomaly/trend/pattern detection, clustering, risk-ranking, data visualization, and/or text mining.
Essential to this role is the ability to translate the data into easy to understand views for communication and reporting.
This is a new role on our team, so you will be paving the way in terms of setting and driving the approach for collecting the right data based on risk, building a data analytics roadmap, and then creating the reports and dashboards with the appropriate views. This will include analysis of different business and functional areas across the company.
You will be responsible for continuously monitoring the data to regularly inform our audit team or management of high-risk areas or anomalies requiring follow-up.
This role will also be looked to as a potential resource for management/leaders outside of audit, so you may also be asked to help with ad-hoc management requests related to data, analytics, or investigations (as they come up).
Qualifications
Bachelor’s degree required in related field (e.g., financial mathematics, actuarial science, management information systems, computer science, accounting, finance, economics, applied statistics)
6 or more years of focused experience in data analytics, forensic data collection, risk/compliance assessments or investigations, advisory, data science, and/or mathematical regression. Since this is a new role, we are open to candidates with more (or slightly less) experience, as long as the technical data expertise and ability to perform the work is apparent. Comp and level will depend on relevant experience.
Public accounting or advisory experience strongly preferred
Familiarity and/or experience working with/in a forensic team using fraud detection technologies and data analysis tools strongly preferred
Proficiency with large data sets and coding tools (.net, Power BI, Python, R, Access, SQL, SharePoint) required
Proficiency in Microsoft Office Suite (Excel, Word, PowerPoint) required
Working knowledge, understanding, and skills using key applications like SAP and PeopleSoft strongly preferred
Practical working experience with financial or business processes (or evaluation of these processes from an audit perspective) and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) strongly preferred
Relevant certifications provide a competitive advantage (e.g., Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE))
Strong verbal and written communication skills required
Can communicate the “so what” message to all levels of an organization
Takes ownerships of projects; results and recommendations are delivered with confidence

internal audit - forensic data scientist,"Internal Audit Forensic Data Scientist

You are a data scientist who wants to grow your career with a truly great company. You have excellent judgement and knowledge of business processes and can effectively apply a risk-based approach to pulling the right data and analyzing the high-risk areas to inform internal audits and business leaders. You work well with others but are independently motivated to make a difference, drive value, provide meaningful recommendations, and get the work done. You’re a curious, determined, action-oriented person, who is motivated to achieve excellence. Are you ready to join us?

In this role, you will have a unique opportunity to see first-hand the financial and operational activities performed in our different business segments. With visibility of the entire company, you can make an immediate impact by delivering data analysis that provides value to management and the board of directors through actionable insight to drive efficiencies and help correct suboptimal behavior. This goes beyond traditional “rules-based” queries and includes anomaly detection, clustering, risk ranking, data visualization, and text mining to assess risks and compliance, detect issues, and identify and predict anomalies.

Internal Audit at Weyerhaeuser is a dynamic, well-respected team that has a strong reputation maintained by knowledgeable team members who deliver timely assurance, identify process improvement opportunities in support of stakeholders, and have great relationships with company leaders and teams built by taking the time to understand their businesses and systems and clearly communicate with candor to provide meaningful feedback and recommendations. You will be a valuable member of this team, and you will work closely with the auditors; however, you will be driving the data analytics to support the audits and risk assessments (as opposed to performing the audit work and testing procedures).


Primary Responsibilities
You will be responsible for working with our IT and business intelligence teams to pull data from different key applications across the company, validate completeness and accuracy of the data, and then use the data to inform our internal audits, investigations, and management insight. This may include mathematical regression and regression analysis, coding and/or advanced queries, statistical-based analysis, anomaly/trend/pattern detection, clustering, risk-ranking, data visualization, and/or text mining.
Essential to this role is the ability to translate the data into easy to understand views for communication and reporting.
This is a new role on our team, so you will be paving the way in terms of setting and driving the approach for collecting the right data based on risk, building a data analytics roadmap, and then creating the reports and dashboards with the appropriate views. This will include analysis of different business and functional areas across the company.
You will be responsible for continuously monitoring the data to regularly inform our audit team or management of high-risk areas or anomalies requiring follow-up.
This role will also be looked to as a potential resource for management/leaders outside of audit, so you may also be asked to help with ad-hoc management requests related to data, analytics, or investigations (as they come up).
Qualifications
Bachelor’s degree required in related field (e.g., financial mathematics, actuarial science, management information systems, computer science, accounting, finance, economics, applied statistics)
6 or more years of focused experience in data analytics, forensic data collection, risk/compliance assessments or investigations, advisory, data science, and/or mathematical regression. Since this is a new role, we are open to candidates with more (or slightly less) experience, as long as the technical data expertise and ability to perform the work is apparent. Comp and level will depend on relevant experience.
Public accounting or advisory experience strongly preferred
Familiarity and/or experience working with/in a forensic team using fraud detection technologies and data analysis tools strongly preferred
Proficiency with large data sets and coding tools (.net, Power BI, Python, R, Access, SQL, SharePoint) required
Proficiency in Microsoft Office Suite (Excel, Word, PowerPoint) required
Working knowledge, understanding, and skills using key applications like SAP and PeopleSoft strongly preferred
Practical working experience with financial or business processes (or evaluation of these processes from an audit perspective) and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) strongly preferred
Relevant certifications provide a competitive advantage (e.g., Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE))
Strong verbal and written communication skills required
Can communicate the “so what” message to all levels of an organization
Takes ownerships of projects; results and recommendations are delivered with confidence
Supports others; solid team player; knows how to win together
Ability to identify potential issues and develop recommendations based on analysis and critical thinking/reasoning skills; adept at using sound reasoning to reach conclusions
Attention to detail and an ability to focus on the big picture
Demonstrated ability to solve complex problems in the absence of technical guidelines or precedents
Helps offer meaningful recommendations that address the root cause rather than symptoms
Demonstrates professional judgement to operate in gray areas
Demonstrates integrity and strong ethical behavior
Builds trust with others through personal authenticity and follow-through on commitments
Actively listens and builds rapport with others
Open and collegial work style with ability to listen and integrate ideas from diverse views and collaborate with others
Process-oriented, highly organized, and effective with time management
Ability to prioritize multiple tasks while maintaining critical attention to detail
Customer-service oriented and track record of positive feedback and demonstrated ability to provide excellent service to stakeholders
Some opportunity to travel to business/site locations to learn the operations (or possibly help with investigations), but regularly occurring travel is not a general expectation or requirement for this role.

internal audit - forensic data scientist,"Internal Audit Forensic Data Scientist

You are a data scientist who wants to grow your career with a truly great company. You have excellent judgement and knowledge of business processes and can effectively apply a risk-based approach to pulling the right data and analyzing the high-risk areas to inform internal audits and business leaders. You work well with others but are independently motivated to make a difference, drive value, provide meaningful recommendations, and get the work done. You’re a curious, determined, action-oriented person, who is motivated to achieve excellence. Are you ready to join us?

In this role, you will have a unique opportunity to see first-hand the financial and operational activities performed in our different business segments. With visibility of the entire company, you can make an immediate impact by delivering data analysis that provides value to management and the board of directors through actionable insight to drive efficiencies and help correct suboptimal behavior. This goes beyond traditional “rules-based” queries and includes anomaly detection, clustering, risk ranking, data visualization, and text mining to assess risks and compliance, detect issues, and identify and predict anomalies.

Internal Audit at Weyerhaeuser is a dynamic, well-respected team that has a strong reputation maintained by knowledgeable team members who deliver timely assurance, identify process improvement opportunities in support of stakeholders, and have great relationships with company leaders and teams built by taking the time to understand their businesses and systems and clearly communicate with candor to provide meaningful feedback and recommendations. You will be a valuable member of this team, and you will work closely with the auditors; however, you will be driving the data analytics to support the audits and risk assessments (as opposed to performing the audit work and testing procedures).


Primary Responsibilities
You will be responsible for working with our IT and business intelligence teams to pull data from different key applications across the company, validate completeness and accuracy of the data, and then use the data to inform our internal audits, investigations, and management insight. This may include mathematical regression and regression analysis, coding and/or advanced queries, statistical-based analysis, anomaly/trend/pattern detection, clustering, risk-ranking, data visualization, and/or text mining.
Essential to this role is the ability to translate the data into easy to understand views for communication and reporting.
This is a new role on our team, so you will be paving the way in terms of setting and driving the approach for collecting the right data based on risk, building a data analytics roadmap, and then creating the reports and dashboards with the appropriate views. This will include analysis of different business and functional areas across the company.
You will be responsible for continuously monitoring the data to regularly inform our audit team or management of high-risk areas or anomalies requiring follow-up.
This role will also be looked to as a potential resource for management/leaders outside of audit, so you may also be asked to help with ad-hoc management requests related to data, analytics, or investigations (as they come up).
Qualifications

internal audit - forensic data scientist,"Internal Audit Forensic Data Scientist

You are a data scientist who wants to grow your career with a truly great company. You have excellent judgement and knowledge of business processes and can effectively apply a risk-based approach to pulling the right data and analyzing the high-risk areas to inform internal audits and business leaders. You work well with others but are independently motivated to make a difference, drive value, provide meaningful recommendations, and get the work done. You’re a curious, determined, action-oriented person, who is motivated to achieve excellence. Are you ready to join us?

In this role, you will have a unique opportunity to see first-hand the financial and operational activities performed in our different business segments. With visibility of the entire company, you can make an immediate impact by delivering data analysis that provides value to management and the board of directors through actionable insight to drive efficiencies and help correct suboptimal behavior. This goes beyond traditional “rules-based” queries and includes anomaly detection, clustering, risk ranking, data visualization, and text mining to assess risks and compliance, detect issues, and identify and predict anomalies.

Internal Audit at Weyerhaeuser is a dynamic, well-respected team that has a strong reputation maintained by knowledgeable team members who deliver timely assurance, identify process improvement opportunities in support of stakeholders, and have great relationships with company leaders and teams built by taking the time to understand their businesses and systems and clearly communicate with candor to provide meaningful feedback and recommendations. You will be a valuable member of this team, and you will work closely with the auditors; however, you will be driving the data analytics to support the audits and risk assessments (as opposed to performing the audit work and testing procedures).


Primary Responsibilities
You will be responsible for working with our IT and business intelligence teams to pull data from different key applications across the company, validate completeness and accuracy of the data, and then use the data to inform our internal audits, investigations, and management insight. This may include mathematical regression and regression analysis, coding and/or advanced queries, statistical-based analysis, anomaly/trend/pattern detection, clustering, risk-ranking, data visualization, and/or text mining.
Essential to this role is the ability to translate the data into easy to understand views for communication and reporting.
This is a new role on our team, so you will be paving the way in terms of setting and driving the approach for collecting the right data based on risk, building a data analytics roadmap, and then creating the reports and dashboards with the appropriate views. This will include analysis of different business and functional areas across the company.
You will be responsible for continuously monitoring the data to regularly inform our audit team or management of high-risk areas or anomalies requiring follow-up.
This role will also be looked to as a potential resource for management/leaders outside of audit, so you may also be asked to help with ad-hoc management requests related to data, analytics, or investigations (as they come up).
Qualifications
Bachelor’s degree required in related field (e.g., financial mathematics, actuarial science, management information systems, computer science, accounting, finance, economics, applied statistics)
6 or more years of focused experience in data analytics, forensic data collection, risk/compliance assessments or investigations, advisory, data science, and/or mathematical regression. Since this is a new role, we are open to candidates with more (or slightly less) experience, as long as the technical data expertise and ability to perform the work is apparent. Comp and level will depend on relevant experience.
Public accounting or advisory experience strongly preferred
Familiarity and/or experience working with/in a forensic team using fraud detection technologies and data analysis tools strongly preferred
Proficiency with large data sets and coding tools (.net, Power BI, Python, R, Access, SQL, SharePoint) required
Proficiency in Microsoft Office Suite (Excel, Word, PowerPoint) required
Working knowledge, understanding, and skills using key applications like SAP and PeopleSoft strongly preferred
Practical working experience with financial or business processes (or evaluation of these processes from an audit perspective) and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) strongly preferred
Relevant certifications provide a competitive advantage (e.g., Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE))
Strong verbal and written communication skills required
Can communicate the “so what” message to all levels of an organization
Takes ownerships of projects; results and recommendations are delivered with confidence
Supports others; solid team player; knows how to win together
Ability to identify potential issues and develop recommendations based on analysis and critical thinking/reasoning skills; adept at using sound reasoning to reach conclusions
Attention to detail and an ability to focus on the big picture
Demonstrated ability to solve complex problems in the absence of technical guidelines or precedents
Helps offer meaningful recommendations that address the root cause rather than symptoms
Demonstrates professional judgement to operate in gray areas
Demonstrates integrity and strong ethical behavior
Builds trust with others through personal authenticity and follow-through on commitments
Actively listens and builds rapport with others
Open and collegial work style with ability to listen and integrate ideas from diverse views and collaborate with others
Process-oriented, highly organized, and effective with time management
Ability to prioritize multiple tasks while maintaining critical attention to detail
Customer-service oriented and track record of positive feedback and demonstrated ability to provide excellent service to stakeholders

internal audit - forensic data scientist,"Internal Audit Forensic Data Scientist

You are a data scientist who wants to grow your career with a truly great company. You have excellent judgement and knowledge of business processes and can effectively apply a risk-based approach to pulling the right data and analyzing the high-risk areas to inform internal audits and business leaders. You work well with others but are independently motivated to make a difference, drive value, provide meaningful recommendations, and get the work done. You’re a curious, determined, action-oriented person, who is motivated to achieve excellence. Are you ready to join us?

In this role, you will have a unique opportunity to see first-hand the financial and operational activities performed in our different business segments. With visibility of the entire company, you can make an immediate impact by delivering data analysis that provides value to management and the board of directors through actionable insight to drive efficiencies and help correct suboptimal behavior. This goes beyond traditional “rules-based” queries and includes anomaly detection, clustering, risk ranking, data visualization, and text mining to assess risks and compliance, detect issues, and identify and predict anomalies.

Internal Audit at Weyerhaeuser is a dynamic, well-respected team that has a strong reputation maintained by knowledgeable team members who deliver timely assurance, identify process improvement opportunities in support of stakeholders, and have great relationships with company leaders and teams built by taking the time to understand their businesses and systems and clearly communicate with candor to provide meaningful feedback and recommendations. You will be a valuable member of this team, and you will work closely with the auditors; however, you will be driving the data analytics to support the audits and risk assessments (as opposed to performing the audit work and testing procedures).


Primary Responsibilities
You will be responsible for working with our IT and business intelligence teams to pull data from different key applications across the company, validate completeness and accuracy of the data, and then use the data to inform our internal audits, investigations, and management insight. This may include mathematical regression and regression analysis, coding and/or advanced queries, statistical-based analysis, anomaly/trend/pattern detection, clustering, risk-ranking, data visualization, and/or text mining.
Essential to this role is the ability to translate the data into easy to understand views for communication and reporting.
This is a new role on our team, so you will be paving the way in terms of setting and driving the approach for collecting the right data based on risk, building a data analytics roadmap, and then creating the reports and dashboards with the appropriate views. This will include analysis of different business and functional areas across the company.
You will be responsible for continuously monitoring the data to regularly inform our audit team or management of high-risk areas or anomalies requiring follow-up.
This role will also be looked to as a potential resource for management/leaders outside of audit, so you may also be asked to help with ad-hoc management requests related to data, analytics, or investigations (as they come up).
Qualifications
Bachelor’s degree required in related field (e.g., financial mathematics, actuarial science, management information systems, computer science, accounting, finance, economics, applied statistics)
6 or more years of focused experience in data analytics, forensic data collection, risk/compliance assessments or investigations, advisory, data science, and/or mathematical regression. Since this is a new role, we are open to candidates with more (or slightly less) experience, as long as the technical data expertise and ability to perform the work is apparent. Comp and level will depend on relevant experience.
Public accounting or advisory experience strongly preferred
Familiarity and/or experience working with/in a forensic team using fraud detection technologies and data analysis tools strongly preferred
Proficiency with large data sets and coding tools (.net, Power BI, Python, R, Access, SQL, SharePoint) required
Proficiency in Microsoft Office Suite (Excel, Word, PowerPoint) required
Working knowledge, understanding, and skills using key applications like SAP and PeopleSoft strongly preferred
Practical working experience with financial or business processes (or evaluation of these processes from an audit perspective) and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) strongly preferred
Relevant certifications provide a competitive advantage (e.g., Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE))
Strong verbal and written communication skills required
Can communicate the “so what” message to all levels of an organization
Takes ownerships of projects; results and recommendations are delivered with confidence
Supports others; solid team player; knows how to win together
Ability to identify potential issues and develop recommendations based on analysis and critical thinking/reasoning skills; adept at using sound reasoning to reach conclusions
Attention to detail and an ability to focus on the big picture
Demonstrated ability to solve complex problems in the absence of technical guidelines or precedents
Helps offer meaningful recommendations that address the root cause rather than symptoms
Demonstrates professional judgement to operate in gray areas
Demonstrates integrity and strong ethical behavior
Builds trust with others through personal authenticity and follow-through on commitments
Actively listens and builds rapport with others
Open and collegial work style with ability to listen and integrate ideas from diverse views and collaborate with others
Process-oriented, highly organized, and effective with time management
Ability to prioritize multiple tasks while maintaining critical attention to detail
Customer-service oriented and track record of positive feedback and demonstrated ability to provide excellent service to stakeholders
Some opportunity to travel to business/site locations to learn the operations (or possibly help with investigations), but regularly occurring travel is not a general expectation or requirement for this role.

internal audit - forensic data scientist,"Internal Audit Forensic Data Scientist

You are a data scientist who wants to grow your career with a truly great company. You have excellent judgement and knowledge of business processes and can effectively apply a risk-based approach to pulling the right data and analyzing the high-risk areas to inform internal audits and business leaders. You work well with others but are independently motivated to make a difference, drive value, provide meaningful recommendations, and get the work done. You’re a curious, determined, action-oriented person, who is motivated to achieve excellence. Are you ready to join us?

In this role, you will have a unique opportunity to see first-hand the financial and operational activities performed in our different business segments. With visibility of the entire company, you can make an immediate impact by delivering data analysis that provides value to management and the board of directors through actionable insight to drive efficiencies and help correct suboptimal behavior. This goes beyond traditional “rules-based” queries and includes anomaly detection, clustering, risk ranking, data visualization, and text mining to assess risks and compliance, detect issues, and identify and predict anomalies.

Internal Audit at Weyerhaeuser is a dynamic, well-respected team that has a strong reputation maintained by knowledgeable team members who deliver timely assurance, identify process improvement opportunities in support of stakeholders, and have great relationships with company leaders and teams built by taking the time to understand their businesses and systems and clearly communicate with candor to provide meaningful feedback and recommendations. You will be a valuable member of this team, and you will work closely with the auditors; however, you will be driving the data analytics to support the audits and risk assessments (as opposed to performing the audit work and testing procedures).


Primary Responsibilities
You will be responsible for working with our IT and business intelligence teams to pull data from different key applications across the company, validate completeness and accuracy of the data, and then use the data to inform our internal audits, investigations, and management insight. This may include mathematical regression and regression analysis, coding and/or advanced queries, statistical-based analysis, anomaly/trend/pattern detection, clustering, risk-ranking, data visualization, and/or text mining.
Essential to this role is the ability to translate the data into easy to understand views for communication and reporting.
This is a new role on our team, so you will be paving the way in terms of setting and driving the approach for collecting the right data based on risk, building a data analytics roadmap, and then creating the reports and dashboards with the appropriate views. This will include analysis of different business and functional areas across the company.
You will be responsible for continuously monitoring the data to regularly inform our audit team or management of high-risk areas or anomalies requiring follow-up.
This role will also be looked to as a potential resource for management/leaders outside of audit, so you may also be asked to help with ad-hoc management requests related to data, analytics, or investigations (as they come up).
Qualifications
Bachelor’s degree required in related field (e.g., financial mathematics, actuarial science, management information systems, computer science, accounting, finance, economics, applied statistics)
6 or more years of focused experience in data analytics, forensic data collection, risk/compliance assessments or investigations, advisory, data science, and/or mathematical regression. Since this is a new role, we are open to candidates with more (or slightly less) experience, as long as the technical data expertise and ability to perform the work is apparent. Comp and level will depend on relevant experience.
Public accounting or advisory experience strongly preferred
Familiarity and/or experience working with/in a forensic team using fraud detection technologies and data analysis tools strongly preferred
Proficiency with large data sets and coding tools (.net, Power BI, Python, R, Access, SQL, SharePoint) required
Proficiency in Microsoft Office Suite (Excel, Word, PowerPoint) required
Working knowledge, understanding, and skills using key applications like SAP and PeopleSoft strongly preferred
Practical working experience with financial or business processes (or evaluation of these processes from an audit perspective) and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) strongly preferred
Relevant certifications provide a competitive advantage (e.g., Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE))
Strong verbal and written communication skills required
Can communicate the “so what” message to all levels of an organization
Takes ownerships of projects; results and recommendations are delivered with confidence
Supports others; solid team player; knows how to win together
Ability to identify potential issues and develop recommendations based on analysis and critical thinking/reasoning skills; adept at using sound reasoning to reach conclusions
Attention to detail and an ability to focus on the big picture
Demonstrated ability to solve complex problems in the absence of technical guidelines or precedents
Helps offer meaningful recommendations that address the root cause rather than symptoms
Demonstrates professional judgement to operate in gray areas
Demonstrates integrity and strong ethical behavior
Builds trust with others through personal authenticity and follow-through on commitments
Actively listens and builds rapport with others
Open and collegial work style with ability to listen and integrate ideas from diverse views and collaborate with others
Process-oriented, highly organized, and effective with time management
Ability to prioritize multiple tasks while maintaining critical attention to detail
Customer-service oriented and track record of positive feedback and demonstrated ability to provide excellent service to stakeholders
Some opportunity to travel to business/site locations to learn the operations (or possibly help with investigations), but regularly occurring travel is not a general expectation or requirement for this role.

internal audit - forensic data scientist,"Internal Audit Forensic Data Scientist

You are a data scientist who wants to grow your career with a truly great company. You have excellent judgement and knowledge of business processes and can effectively apply a risk-based approach to pulling the right data and analyzing the high-risk areas to inform internal audits and business leaders. You work well with others but are independently motivated to make a difference, drive value, provide meaningful recommendations, and get the work done. You’re a curious, determined, action-oriented person, who is motivated to achieve excellence. Are you ready to join us?

In this role, you will have a unique opportunity to see first-hand the financial and operational activities performed in our different business segments. With visibility of the entire company, you can make an immediate impact by delivering data analysis that provides value to management and the board of directors through actionable insight to drive efficiencies and help correct suboptimal behavior. This goes beyond traditional “rules-based” queries and includes anomaly detection, clustering, risk ranking, data visualization, and text mining to assess risks and compliance, detect issues, and identify and predict anomalies.

Internal Audit at Weyerhaeuser is a dynamic, well-respected team that has a strong reputation maintained by knowledgeable team members who deliver timely assurance, identify process improvement opportunities in support of stakeholders, and have great relationships with company leaders and teams built by taking the time to understand their businesses and systems and clearly communicate with candor to provide meaningful feedback and recommendations. You will be a valuable member of this team, and you will work closely with the auditors; however, you will be driving the data analytics to support the audits and risk assessments (as opposed to performing the audit work and testing procedures).


Primary Responsibilities
You will be responsible for working with our IT and business intelligence teams to pull data from different key applications across the company, validate completeness and accuracy of the data, and then use the data to inform our internal audits, investigations, and management insight. This may include mathematical regression and regression analysis, coding and/or advanced queries, statistical-based analysis, anomaly/trend/pattern detection, clustering, risk-ranking, data visualization, and/or text mining.
Essential to this role is the ability to translate the data into easy to understand views for communication and reporting.
This is a new role on our team, so you will be paving the way in terms of setting and driving the approach for collecting the right data based on risk, building a data analytics roadmap, and then creating the reports and dashboards with the appropriate views. This will include analysis of different business and functional areas across the company.
You will be responsible for continuously monitoring the data to regularly inform our audit team or management of high-risk areas or anomalies requiring follow-up.
This role will also be looked to as a potential resource for management/leaders outside of audit, so you may also be asked to help with ad-hoc management requests related to data, analytics, or investigations (as they come up).
Qualifications
Bachelor’s degree required in related field (e.g., financial mathematics, actuarial science, management information systems, computer science, accounting, finance, economics, applied statistics)
6 or more years of focused experience in data analytics, forensic data collection, risk/compliance assessments or investigations, advisory, data science, and/or mathematical regression. Since this is a new role, we are open to candidates with more (or slightly less) experience, as long as the technical data expertise and ability to perform the work is apparent. Comp and level will depend on relevant experience.
Public accounting or advisory experience strongly preferred
Familiarity and/or experience working with/in a forensic team using fraud detection technologies and data analysis tools strongly preferred
Proficiency with large data sets and coding tools (.net, Power BI, Python, R, Access, SQL, SharePoint) required
Proficiency in Microsoft Office Suite (Excel, Word, PowerPoint) required
Working knowledge, understanding, and skills using key applications like SAP and PeopleSoft strongly preferred
Practical working experience with financial or business processes (or evaluation of these processes from an audit perspective) and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) strongly preferred
Relevant certifications provide a competitive advantage (e.g., Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE))
Strong verbal and written communication skills required
Can communicate the “so what” message to all levels of an organization
Takes ownerships of projects; results and recommendations are delivered with confidence
Supports others; solid team player; knows how to win together
Ability to identify potential issues and develop recommendations based on analysis and critical thinking/reasoning skills; adept at using sound reasoning to reach conclusions
Attention to detail and an ability to focus on the big picture
Demonstrated ability to solve complex problems in the absence of technical guidelines or precedents
Helps offer meaningful recommendations that address the root cause rather than symptoms
Demonstrates professional judgement to operate in gray areas
Demonstrates integrity and strong ethical behavior
Builds trust with others through personal authenticity and follow-through on commitments
Actively listens and builds rapport with others
Open and collegial work style with ability to listen and integrate ideas from diverse views and collaborate with others
Process-oriented, highly organized, and effective with time management
Ability to prioritize multiple tasks while maintaining critical attention to detail
Customer-service oriented and track record of positive feedback and demonstrated ability to provide excellent service to stakeholders
Some opportunity to travel to business/site locations to learn the operations (or possibly help with investigations), but regularly occurring travel is not a general expectation or requirement for this role.

You will be a valuable member of this team, and you will work closely with the auditors; however, you will be driving the data analytics to support the audits and risk assessments (as opposed to performing the audit work and testing procedures).


Primary Responsibilities
You will be responsible for working with our IT and business intelligence teams to pull data from different key applications across the company, validate completeness and accuracy of the data, and then use the data to inform our internal audits, investigations, and management insight. This may include mathematical regression and regression analysis, coding and/or advanced queries, statistical-based analysis, anomaly/trend/pattern detection, clustering, risk-ranking, data visualization, and/or text mining.
Essential to this role is the ability to translate the data into easy to understand views for communication and reporting.
This is a new role on our team, so you will be paving the way in terms of setting and driving the approach for collecting the right data based on risk, building a data analytics roadmap, and then creating the reports and dashboards with the appropriate views. This will include analysis of different business and functional areas across the company.
You will be responsible for continuously monitoring the data to regularly inform our audit team or management of high-risk areas or anomalies requiring follow-up.
This role will also be looked to as a potential resource for management/leaders outside of audit, so you may also be asked to help with ad-hoc management requests related to data, analytics, or investigations (as they come up).
Qualifications
Bachelor’s degree required in related field (e.g., financial mathematics, actuarial science, management information systems, computer science, accounting, finance, economics, applied statistics)
6 or more years of focused experience in data analytics, forensic data collection, risk/compliance assessments or investigations, advisory, data science, and/or mathematical regression. Since this is a new role, we are open to candidates with more (or slightly less) experience, as long as the technical data expertise and ability to perform the work is apparent. Comp and level will depend on relevant experience.
Public accounting or advisory experience strongly preferred
Familiarity and/or experience working with/in a forensic team using fraud detection technologies and data analysis tools strongly preferred
Proficiency with large data sets and coding tools (.net, Power BI, Python, R, Access, SQL, SharePoint) required
Proficiency in Microsoft Office Suite (Excel, Word, PowerPoint) required
Working knowledge, understanding, and skills using key applications like SAP and PeopleSoft strongly preferred
Practical working experience with financial or business processes (or evaluation of these processes from an audit perspective) and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) strongly preferred
Relevant certifications provide a competitive advantage (e.g., Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE))
Strong verbal and written communication skills required
Can communicate the “so what” message to all levels of an organization
Takes ownerships of projects; results and recommendations are delivered with confidence
Supports others; solid team player; knows how to win together
Ability to identify potential issues and develop recommendations based on analysis and critical thinking/reasoning skills; adept at using sound reasoning to reach conclusions
Attention to detail and an ability to focus on the big picture
Demonstrated ability to solve complex problems in the absence of technical guidelines or precedents
Helps offer meaningful recommendations that address the root cause rather than symptoms
Demonstrates professional judgement to operate in gray areas
Demonstrates integrity and strong ethical behavior
Builds trust with others through personal authenticity and follow-through on commitments
Actively listens and builds rapport with others
Open and collegial work style with ability to listen and integrate ideas from diverse views and collaborate with others
Process-oriented, highly organized, and effective with time management
Ability to prioritize multiple tasks while maintaining critical attention to detail
Customer-service oriented and track record of positive feedback and demonstrated ability to provide excellent service to stakeholders
Some opportunity to travel to business/site locations to learn the operations (or possibly help with investigations), but regularly occurring travel is not a general expectation or requirement for this role.

This will include analysis of different business and functional areas across the company.
You will be responsible for continuously monitoring the data to regularly inform our audit team or management of high-risk areas or anomalies requiring follow-up.
This role will also be looked to as a potential resource for management/leaders outside of audit, so you may also be asked to help with ad-hoc management requests related to data, analytics, or investigations (as they come up).
Qualifications
Bachelor’s degree required in related field (e.g., financial mathematics, actuarial science, management information systems, computer science, accounting, finance, economics, applied statistics)
6 or more years of focused experience in data analytics, forensic data collection, risk/compliance assessments or investigations, advisory, data science, and/or mathematical regression.

Demonstrated ability to solve complex problems in the absence of technical guidelines or precedents
Helps offer meaningful recommendations that address the root cause rather than symptoms
Demonstrates professional judgement to operate in gray areas
Demonstrates integrity and strong ethical behavior
Builds trust with others through personal authenticity and follow-through on commitments
Actively listens and builds rapport with others
Open and collegial work style with ability to listen and integrate ideas from diverse views and collaborate with others
Process-oriented, highly organized, and effective with time management
Ability to prioritize multiple tasks while maintaining critical attention to detail

Why Clarity Insights, Why Consulting and Why Now?

We don’t try to be everything to everybody all the time. We specialize in Data & Analytics and will remain a platform and tool agnostic company so you can grow technically throughout your career. It sounds ridiculous but you actually need to be 100% technical and 100% business with strategy because we don’t hire non-communicative robots who have a one size fits all approach. We often could speak to a CFO or Head of Underwriting about a business or finance problem, and based on the need for real-time and affordable scalability, we can outline – in terms they can understand – why they should think about a cloud solution for big data and analytics. If we step across to the DevOps lab, we can easily pick up on a conversation about Apache committers, OSF, full stack development, microservices, containers – you know – GEEK OUT. We’re not trying to boil the ocean. We want to grow from 400 people to 1700 people in 4 years to take the market an accessible set of consulting skills. We have a lot of fun together. Most people join here and stay here for the people. That said, we are popular so we do rack up some travel miles. I have a million things to share about why that may change and why that must stay the same for now, but here’s a suggestion – if you LOVE Cloud Computing for Big Data and/or Advanced Analytics, Machine Learning, etc we should talk.

Recently ranked #5 in Forbes Magazine's list of America's Most Promising Companies, Carvana offers the excitement, culture, and opportunity of a start-up, along with the capitalization and infrastructure of an established business.

We sell cars, but we're not salespeople. At Carvana, we've made it our mission to transform how cars are bought and sold. We saw a huge problem with how much it can suck to buy a car the traditional way so we committed to tackling one of the largest, yet-to-be-disrupted markets in the world – the $1T per year U.S. car market (yes, that's $Trillion with a ""T"").

We provide a seamless, online car buying experience for consumers. From our searchable showroom of fully-inspected, certified cars, to high-resolution 360° photographs of our vehicles' interior and exterior, to real-time financing and warranty packages. With delivery possible to the buyer's driveway in 24 hours or pick-up available from one of our state-of-the-art car vending machines (yes, you read that right) all with a 7-day money back guarantee, customer satisfaction is at the core of our business. With no dealerships or commissioned sales people, we also save thousands of dollars per car that we pass on to our customers.

For more information on Carvana, take a look at our company introduction video ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5dpBRp0-_w ).

In return for your hard work, you'll have an opportunity to work at one of the fastest growing and creative technology companies around, as well as help us promote a life-changing product and develop a world-class team every day.

In our down time we have ping pong and corn hole (or ""bags,"" depending on where you're from) tournaments. However, the pace is pretty quick around here, so you'll need to be prepared to keep up.

Create the model that transforms how real estate deals close
************************************************************

Want to infuse a $20B sector of the insurance and real estate industry with predictive analytics and a tech-forward customer experience? Yearning for a startup culture within a profitable nationwide company? Join States Title ( https://statestitle.com/ ) and send an entirely new type of real estate model into the wild.

It's no secret the housing market has peaked. Lenders, banks and realtors are dying to know how to ride the down market and boost their margins. They are switching their customers to States Title because our data science algorithms, streamlined deal closing technologies, and overall product experience is leaps and bounds above what they're used to in terms of speed and value.

Every mortgage or refinance transaction needs our product: title and escrow. Title insurance protects banks and homeowners against financially irresponsible actors or legal issues that cloud their rights; escrow makes sure the right people get paid at the end of the day.

Our streamlined, efficient algorithms have revolutionized the title and escrow process and allowed us to scale rapidly: we closed our acquisition of North American Title Company on January 7th. With a broader nationwide footprint, we are poised to transform this industry, repurposing the billions wasted in rote, manual tasks to make homeownership easier and less risky, helping people invest time and money into more meaningful parts of their lives.

***********************************
We're growing our data science team
***********************************

As a data scientist at States Title, you'll take part in a fun and respectful corporate atmosphere. You'll interact frequently with an executive team that has significant accomplishments at PayPal, McKinsey, and Capital One behind them. Much more than a model builder, you'll talk directly with VP+ customers and stakeholders, vet and negotiate deals with vendors, recommend strategies to change the direction of the company, and discuss data stewardship and model governance with deep legal minds in the public and private sectors.

We're proud of the sophisticated data ingestion process we have built, as well as the multi-model ecosystem that is already live, with its parts working together to orchestrate an instant insurance decision in a robust, well-managed, and well-tested way. We have high expectations of communication, accountability, and mathematical rigor, and are looking for those who would be inspired and stimulated in such an environment.

**************************
Do you have what it takes?
**************************


2-10 years of relevant experience in data science
What's relevant? Any of the following:
Fintech: you've built credit risk, fraud, or insurance models or algorithms and worked with engineering teams to deploy them
Academia: you've used real-world data to publish highly cited peer-reviewed journal articles on prediction or inference using open source tools
Series A and Series B start-up environments: you've served a catch-all analytics role doing everything from data cleaning to SQL joins to building predictive models
Our definition of data science:
Data science is computerized math that makes inferences or predicts the future with enough accuracy to meet the key goals of an organization
Strengths aligned with our needs
Theoretical background relevant to data science
E.g. Can you explain how to build a random forest without making reference to computers?
Technical skills
E.g. When you write a python library that tests the score distribution of incoming orders against expectation, does Engineering praise the quality of your code?
Creative skills
E.g. When out-of-the-box regression on a continuous target isn't good enough, can you come up with a customized loss function for the problem?
Collaboration skills
E.g. Can you get a group to make a controversial decision in fewer than 30 minutes?
